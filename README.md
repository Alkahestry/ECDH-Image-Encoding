# ECDH-Image-Encoding

This is a Python implementation based on M. Kumar et al.'s algorithm for image security using ECC diversified with DNA encoding. In this method, the authors first encode the RGB image using DNA encoding followed by asymmetric encryption based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman encryption.

## Installation


```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Alkahestry/ECDH-Image-Encoding.git
```

## Usage

This repository is a half-finish image cryptography algorithm hence it serves as a template for any image cryptography algorithm, please make the most use out of it.


## Contributing
