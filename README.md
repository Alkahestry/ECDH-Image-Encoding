# ECDH-Image-Encoding

This is a Python implementation based on M. Kumar et al.'s algorithm for image security using ECC diversified with DNA encoding. In this method, the authors first encode the RGB image using DNA encoding followed by asymmetric encryption based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman encryption.

## Installation


```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Alkahestry/ECDH-Image-Encoding.git
```

## Usage


This repository is a half-finish image cryptography algorithm hence it serves as a template for any image cryptography algorithm, please make the most use out of it.


## Algorithm


This algorithm includes the following steps:
+ DNA encoding on RGB image
+ DNA addition for further scrambling the image
+ Unique random shift sequences for each dimension with amount based on ECDH shared keys.
+ Interleaving the RGB dimensions
